### NBA Avg Age For Positions
This is the average age for each position in the NBA some players play more than one position this is why there are positions that are repeated but catagorized with another position.

### Team Average FG Pct
This graph shows the FG Percentage for each team from 1982 - 2022. With this graph we cant really gather too much since some teams have relocated/ renamed so this will create outliers. For example KCK (Kansas City Kings) are no longer in kansas city they are the sacramento kings. Though they have the highest percentage its not fair to compare to the others who parcentage has been weighed down by playing more seasons.

## Team Average FG Pct 2022 Season
To clear up the issues in the last graph with the outlieres here we are only comparing the teams currently in the nba for the 2022 season. For the 2022 season the 76ers were the best at shooting of all the teams. It was a close battle however with the Golden State Warriors who did go on to win the Finals this year.
